# Taskey

## Your perfect to do list solution for organization throughout your days and weeks.

---

Taskey is a **web based** application that helps to organize your daily, weekly, and monthly tasks by using cards organized neatly into columns, and featuring a **color coded** system for the cards to help quickly identify the status of your tasks. Taskey is *persistent within your local systems memory* to store your list of tasks, ensuring that you can close the web page and come back to it whenever you need to on the same device with your task list still in place.

## <span style="color:#79BAEC">HOW IT WORKS
Tasks are entered in using our intuitive entry form. When your task looks exactly how you want it, click the Add Task button to add it to your list. It will automatically be assigned to the appropriate column correlating to it's due date.

Taskey's color coding system is designed to help you quickly recognize the status of your to do list items.

* <span style="color:#FFF380"> Yellow for still To Do</span>

* <span style="color:#79BAEC"> Blue for In Progress</span>

* <span style="color:#D16587"> Pink for Stuck</span>

* <span style="color:#6AFB92"> Green for Done</span>

![Task Cards](https://github.com/mirawinkel/Final-Project/blob/main/img/TaskCards.png)

Cards Marked <span style="color:#6AFB92">Done</span>, or who are older than today's date, are moved to the left column signifying that they are done, or that their time window is expired.

Tasks can be adjusted, or have their status changed by clicking on the <span style="color:#A74AC7">Adjust Task</span> button on the card.
When clicked, the card information is moved into the entry form, and the adjust task button replaces the add task button.
When everything is adjusted to your liking, click the adjust task button under the entry fields to change the card within the list area.

If you decide you don't want to adjust the task, you can click the cancel button to clear the form fields preparing you for a new task.

Tasks are easily removed from the column area by clicking the <span style="color:#9F000F">Remove Task</span> button on the cards themselves. Be careful though, when you remove a task it is completely removed from the memory.
